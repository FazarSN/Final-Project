# Final-Project
this is my final project for finishing my study

I created python codes to do quadrat counting method in Spatial Point Process data (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_process)
it includes making the quadrat (in my case I use circle and Wedge, but it can be generalized to any quadrat), test the counting to Poisson distribution, and plot the result in map (because my study case is Earthquake data).
